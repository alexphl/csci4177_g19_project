### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.
