## Running the Project Locally:
Check that you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Ensure that you have Node 14.6.0 or later installed:
```bash
node -v
```

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/cparker/csci4177_group19_project.git
```

Navigate to the csci4177_group19_project directory:
```bash
cd csci4177_group19_project
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project folder to store the environment variables like the database username and password and third-party API keys. The `.env` file should look like this:
```
DB_USER=""
DB_USER_PASSWORD=""
DB_URL=""
FINNHUB_API_KEY=""
Newsapikey=
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Wait for the project to build, then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 or the port specified in the console when prompted.
