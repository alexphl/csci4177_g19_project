## Getting Started

**[Optional]** If needing to provide the marker with a copy of the project that should run on their local machine for development, testing and/or marking purposes. Please include the following sections.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To be run locally, this application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 18.x or newer to be installed.

PLease follow the official [Node installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for downloads and setup.

### Installing dependencies

In order to install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory (one with package.json) in your terminal and run:

```
npm install
```
Once the installation completes, you can run or build the app.


### Running the development server

You can preview the app locally by running:

```
npm run dev
```

The server will run on localhost, and the target port will be communicated in the console output. If successful, you should be able to see the StockVision login page when you navigate to the localhost URL in your browser.


Tip: the development server lets you instantly preview any changes to the app, without having to be restarted between them.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.
